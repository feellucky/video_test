We use the following conventions:

master: only for release
devel: this is the development branch. This one should always work (tests can’t be broken)
topic/$name: when we start to develop a new feature, we create a topic branch
hotfix/$name: when we need to release a new version right now, without merging devel before, we create a hofrix branch
release/$version: when we’re ready to ship, we create a new branch
